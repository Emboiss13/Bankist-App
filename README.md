A **minimalist online banking application** built as part of my JavaScript course project on Udemy. The project is designed to practice working with **arrays**, **objects**, and **UI updates** in real-world scenarios.  

You can check out a live demo here: [bankist.netlify.app](https://bankist.netlify.app)  
(use `user: js` and `pin: 1111` to try it out).  


## 📌 Features  
- **Login System** – log in with a username and PIN.  
- **Display Movements** – shows deposits and withdrawals.  
- **Account Balance** – calculates and updates total balance.  
- **Summary Data** – displays income, expenses, and interest.  
- **Transfer Money** – send funds to another account.  
- **Request Loan** – request a loan that gets added as a deposit.  
- **Close Account** – permanently delete an account.  
- **Sort Movements** – toggle between sorted and unsorted view.  


## 🗂️ Project Structure  
- **Account Data** – stored as JavaScript objects inside an array (simulating API data).  
- **Flow Chart** – provides a roadmap of all app actions (login, UI updates, operations).  
- **HTML/CSS** – pre-styled files with selected elements to speed up development.  
- **JavaScript** – logic for user authentication, UI updates, and array-based calculations.  


## 🧑‍💻 Learning Goals  
- Practice **array methods** (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, etc.).  
- Work with **objects inside arrays** to mimic real-world API data.  
- Understand **UI updates** and **event-driven programming** in JavaScript.  
- Explore the concept of **abstraction** through functions and flowcharts.  


## 📚 Key Takeaways  
- The **Bankist app** is a great exercise in building interactive, real-world applications.  
- It demonstrates how arrays and objects power features like **money transfers, loans, and account balances**.  
- The **flow chart** acts as a roadmap for development, ensuring structured implementation.  
- The data is structured in a way similar to what you’d expect from a **Web API**.
